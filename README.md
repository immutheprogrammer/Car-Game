# Car-Game
A simple car game I made to learn the basics of c# and monogame!

If you find any issues please report it 

btw idk if my code is bad becuase im new to monogame and c# so...

This game tought me about the basics of monogame and c#!

you can also get the CarGame.exe file aswell without the source code. 

About Me:

I am a 12 year old game dev!

when I am older I want to work in the games industry



Building On Linux and Mac:

To run on linux and mac you have to install https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/ (mono runtime) then you need to go into 
termial and go to the directory the CarGame.exe file is in and type in "mono CarGame.exe" and that should open the game!
